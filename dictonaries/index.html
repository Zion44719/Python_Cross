      A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. It is a versatile data structure that allows you to store and
      retrieve values based on a unique key. Dictionaries are mutable, which means you can modify them after they are
      created.
    </p>
    <p>Dictionaries in Python are highly useful for tasks such as mapping, where you want to associate unique keys with
      values. They are commonly used in various applications, including web development, data analysis, and more, due to
      their flexibility and efficiency in storing and retrieving data.</p>
